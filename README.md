谷歌官方Jetpack Compose课程 之 创建名片app。

上传上来当备份&记录，顺便体验一下Github。

这几天学得津津有味，希望寒假结束之前能学完，早日把构想中的app变为现实😋

注释写得尽可能详细了，希望能帮到其他的初学者😊

Google's Official Jetpack Compose Course - Creating a Business Card App

I'm uploading this as a backup & record, and also to get some experience with GitHub. 
I've been enjoying the learning process these past few days, and I hope to finish all the courses before the winter break ends so I can turn my envisioned app into reality 😋

I've tried to write the comments as detailed as possible, hoping it will help other beginners 😊
(However, I am a Chinese so all the comments are written in Chinese)
